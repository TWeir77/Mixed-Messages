# Mixed-Messages
This is a simple program for generating random messages inspired by Action-Based Anime
## Functionality
Uses an object with a set of arrays to display:
  1. Character
  2. Motivational Dialogue
  3. Mission Objective

A random element is chosen from each of the three arrays and logged to the console. 
Each accompanied by a string message to give the overall message generation more impact.

## Future Dev
In order to bring out the potential of this code, I would like to:
  + Develop a simple website
  + Big Button
  + Prompt User to click Big Button
  + Deliver randomized Message

This code could also work into future projects by providing foundation for another idea regarding ranomized messages.
However, using tools such as data storage, requires more learning at the moment. 
Otherwise, Javascript could potentially rewrite code to store a list of the generated messages on the web page, should the button be clicked multiple times.
